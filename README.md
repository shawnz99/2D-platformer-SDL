#         2D-platformer-SDL

This project was something I had did last spring as an attempt to figure out how game development worked. I had read an article on how to properly set up SDL a project thats why I have things all nice and neat in folders such as /src and /res for imags and /bin for the libraries. However after that everything is all me.
