#         2D-platformer-SDL

This project was something I had did last spring as an attempt to figure out how game development worked. I had read an article on how to properly set up SDL a project thats why I have things all nice and neat in folders such as `/src` and `/res` for imags and /bin for the libraries. However after that everything is all me (except for looking at the SDL documentation for the usage of their libraries). It is in C because at the time it was the language that I felt most comforatable with. I realized after a while of trying to develop this game that a object oriented language would probably be much easier to develop a game in but I felt that I was already too far in and should just continue with C.

All the source code is in the `/src/main2.c` file, it was not until I was well into this project that I realized I should have probably split things up into different files instead of having it all in one file. That is why everything is a jumbled mess, so to anyone who will be glancing at my code, I apologize for that.

To be honest Its a stretch to call this a "game" I only really had a guy that walked around and jumped and that was it, but it was more the process of learning that I was interested in rather than a complete game.
