#         2D-platformer-SDL

This project was something I had did last spring as an attempt to figure out how game development worked. I had read an article on how to properly set up SDL a project thats why I have things all nice and neat in folders such as `/src` and `/res` for imags and /bin for the libraries. However after that everything is all me. 

All the source code is in the `/src/main2.c` file, it was not until I was well into this project that I realized I should have probably split things up into different files instead of having it all in one file. That is why everything is a jumbled mess, so to anyone who will be glancing at my code, I apologize for that.
